    correctAnswer: 1,
    image: "img/aptis3_question1.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'to' is the correct preposition used with the verb 'tell' to indicate what someone is instructed to do (eg 'tells me to').  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) to'.",

      "Back in the day, my parents ______ party until dawn because they had early college classes every weekday.",
    choices: ["A) won't", "B) would", "C) wouldn't"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'wouldn't' is a contraction that means 'would not'.  The word 'won't' connects to the present tense – and perhaps the future as well – whereas the word 'would' is positive and doesn't connect with the word 'because'.  The speaker's parents 'wouldn't party until dawn <u>because</u> they had early college classes every weekday' makes the most sense.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) wouldn't'.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'had' is correct because it shows that 'they' finished eating before the speaker and his/her partner/friend/group arrived.  It’s the past perfect tense, indicating an action completed before another past action.  It is positive and not the negative word 'hadn't' because the event 'had' been completed 'when we showed up'.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) had'.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "In this case, the word 'wouldn't' fits perfectly.  It implies that pulling all-nighters is a consequence of not being a better student.  The complete correct sentence reads: 'If you were a better student, you wouldn't need to pull all-nighter study sessions all the time'.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) wouldn't'.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The phrase 'was issued' is the correct answer because it indicates that she received a ticket due to not wearing her seatbelt—it's a passive construction showing what happened to her.  The complete correct sentence is: 'The driver was issued a ticket because she wasn't wearing her seatbelt'.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) was issued'.",

    explanation:
      "We use 'fewer' for countable nouns, so saying 'fewer than ten candidates' is correct because candidates can be counted individually.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) fewer'.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'definitely' means certainly or without a doubt.  It is the right choice here because it clearly expresses certainty about re-ordering from that company—it's all about being sure.  The words 'defiantly' and 'finitely' don't express certainty and are grammatically incorrect.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) definitely'.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'Don't' is the correct form for the second-person ('you') in the present tense.  In this sentence, it’s used in the imperative form, telling someone ('you') not to make up stories.  The words 'Doesn't' and 'Didn't' don't make logical or grammatical sense in the sentence, with the complete correct sentence reading: 'Don't make up stories that you think I want to hear'.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) Don't'.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The question 'How come you won't share your wisdom?' uses 'come' in a colloquial way to ask why something is the case—it's informal but widely understood.  The other two answer choices 'A) often' and 'B) ever' don't make sense.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) come'.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'pricey' is an informal adjective meaning 'expensive', which fits perfectly when describing the cost of living downtown.  The word conveys that it's higher than average.  The words 'priced' and 'pricier' don't make sense in the context of this sentence.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) pricey'.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'traveling' is the gerund form and fits well here as it describes the activity 'they' enjoyed doing throughout the south of France during the holidays.  The phrase 'enjoyed traveling' makes sense in the context of this sentence – and not 'enjoyed travel' or 'enjoyed travelers'.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) traveling'.",

    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'multilingual' describes someone who speaks multiple languages, making it the best choice for Harry's ability to communicate in several languages.  The other two options are specific to two languages ('bilingual') or three languages ('trilingual').  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) multilingual'.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The phrase 'I will have worked for 18 hours straight' uses the future perfect tense.  The phrase 'will worked' doesn't make grammatical sense whereas 'have worked' only makes sense if the sentence is set in the past, not in the future.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'A) will have'.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'visited' is in the past tense and fits well here because it refers to a specific experience this year—indicating something he/she has already done.  It is simple past tense because the event happened in the past.  The complete correct sentence is: 'Orange County is one of the most beautiful counties I visited this year.'.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) visited'.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The phrase 'letting me down' means disappointing the speaker, which captures how the speaker feels about their old friends' actions.  The phrases 'letting me on' and 'letting me under' don't make sense though 'leading me on' is a dating reference and may make sense in a different context.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'C) down'.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'should've' is a contraction for 'should have', indicating regret or missed obligation, suggesting that 'You' attending Harold's send-off would have been a good idea.  The correct complete sentence would read: 'You missed a fun send-off for Harold last night.  You should've come'.  The other two words 'shouldn't've' and 'should' would make sense in different contexts, but neither make sense in the context of this sentence.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) should've'.",

    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The phrase 'Although he worked hard all week' introduces a contrast, showing that despite his hard work, he chose to take time off on the weekend.  The complete correct sentence reads: 'Although he worked hard all week, he took the entire weekend off to spend time with his family, friends, and pets'.  The words 'Then' and 'Therefore' don't make sense in this context.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'A) Although'.",

    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'Moreover' adds information about his work habits, indicating that in addition to arriving early, he also stayed late most weekdays—it's about building on the previous statement.  The words 'Still' and 'However' reflect contrast from the previous sentence whereas 'Moreover' reflects a support of the previous sentence and its logic.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) Moreover'.",

    explanation:
      "The phrase 'In spite of the warm weather' correctly introduces a contrast; it shows that even with warm weather conditions, 'he' still wore a jacket all day.  Most people probably wouldn't wear a jacket all day outside if it's warm out.  This is why 'B) In spite' is correct.",

    explanation:
      "The phrase 'fell asleep' is the correct past tense form here, indicating that 'He' lost consciousness 'while working from home for twelve hours straight yesterday'.  Hence, the correct answer is 'A) fell' and not 'falls' or 'fallen' as the latter words don't make grammatical or logical sense in this context.",

The phrases 'invest capital on his fledgling business' and 'invest capital unto his fledgling business' don't make grammatical sense.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'A) in'.",

      "The phrase 'will have been sold' indicates future perfect passive voice, suggesting that by September, those copies are expected to be sold—a prediction about the future.  The complete correct sentence reads: 'It is anticipated that 100,000 copies of his coffee table book will have been sold by September'.  The month 'September' is presumed to be in the future.  The phrase 'will been' doesn't make sense in any context whereas 'are being' doesn't make sense in this particular context.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) will have been'.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    image: "img/aptis3_q2-25.png",
    explanation:
      "The word 'would' fits best here as the word is grammatically correct in this context.  The opening phrase of the question is as follows: 'Why would he choose to hire an outsider…'?  The word 'would' is used to discuss hypothetical situations and this is a hypothetical context.  The word 'will' is used to discuss something that is bound to happen, not a hypothetical or potential event or decision.  The word 'wouldn't' doesn't make sense in this context.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) would'.",
